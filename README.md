# Hackomania 2023 - Wajipedia

Wajipedia is a winning project from the Hackomania 2023 hackathon, where we participated in a challenge proposed by the IIIT Hyderabad's WikiClub Chair. Our team developed a Wikipedia clone with innovative features aimed at enhancing accessibility and user experience.

## Challenge Description

The challenge required us to create a web application with features catering to users with disabilities, particularly those with motor impairments, visual impairments, and elderly users. Additionally, the application needed to incorporate functionalities that enhance accessibility for users with disabilities, such as text-to-speech capabilities and customizable font styles.

## Project Overview

Wajipedia serves as a Wikipedia clone with several accessibility features and enhancements to the user interface. Here's an overview of its key features:

### 1. Sundar Pichai Interface

The application starts with an interface showcasing information about Sundar Pichai, providing users with an initial glimpse of the platform's capabilities and layout.

### 2. Search Functionality

Users can search for articles on various topics using the search bar. Upon entering a query, relevant search results are displayed, allowing users to explore articles of interest.

### 3. Dynamic Content Display

Selected search results replace the existing content on the page, including the main article text and accompanying images. This dynamic content display ensures a seamless browsing experience.

### 4. Floating Button

A floating button is incorporated into the interface, providing users with the ability to perform various actions conveniently. This button includes functionalities such as auto-scrolling and text-to-speech.

### 5. Auto-Scrolling

The auto-scrolling feature caters to users with motor impairments or those who are unable to use traditional scrolling methods. By clicking the floating button, users can enable auto-scrolling, allowing them to navigate through articles effortlessly.

### 6. Text-to-Speech

Wajipedia offers text-to-speech functionality, enabling users to listen to the content of selected articles. This feature benefits visually impaired users and individuals who prefer auditory content consumption.

### 7. Customizable Font and Styles

Users can customize the font size, font family, and text color according to their preferences. This feature ensures a personalized reading experience and accommodates users with visual impairments or specific readability preferences.
